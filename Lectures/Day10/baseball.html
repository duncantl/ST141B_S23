--
+ This just gives the salaries

+ Can also get the other columns in the Salaries table.

+ What's wrong?

# Adding the Name of Team

--

+ Multiple rows in Teams for each team, but different years.

+ Confirm?
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Teams
WHERE teamID = "TEX";

SELECT DISTINCT yearID
FROM Teams
WHERE teamID = "TEX";

SELECT yearID, COUNT(*)
FROM Teams
WHERE teamID = "TEX"
GROUP BY yearID;
```

  + So T.teamID = A.teamID matches multiple rows for each year.

  + Need to restrict to `T.yearID = 2003`

     +   or equivalently  `T.yearID = A.yearID`

---
# Joing with Teams for given yearId

```sql
SELECT   nameFirst || ' ' || nameLast AS Name,
         A.yearID,
         debut,
         salary,
         A.teamID,
         A.lgID,
         T.name
FROM Salaries AS A, Master AS B, Teams AS T
WHERE A.yearID = 2003
  AND T.yearID = A.yearID                <---------
  AND A.playerID = B.playerID
  AND T.teamID = A.teamID
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

---
# Finding **all** the players with these salaries

+ In case of ties for salary, there may be more than three.

+ To get all of the players with these 3 salaries, we can use a nested query

```sql
SELECT nameFirst, nameLast, salary, teamID, yearID, birthYear 
FROM  Salaries AS A, Master AS B  
WHERE yearID = 2003
  AND A.playerID = B.playerID 
  AND salary IN (SELECT salary 
                   FROM Salaries 
	           WHERE yearID = 2003 
	  	   ORDER BY salary DESC
                   LIMIT 3);
```

# Has the distribution of home runs for players increased over the years?

+ Maximum number of home runs by a single player?

+ Total number of home runs by all players?

+ See Batting table
--

```sql
SELECT yearID, MAX(HR) AS maxHR
FROM Batting
GROUP BY yearID
ORDER BY maxHR DESC;
```

---
# Total number of Home Runs by Year

+ Add up all the home runs for each year

```sql
SELECT yearID, SUM(HR) AS maxHR
FROM Batting
GROUP BY yearID
ORDER BY maxHR DESC;
```

---
# What team *won* the World Series each year?

+ include the name of the team, league and division.

+ Which tables?

--
   + SeriesPost
```
CREATE TABLE SeriesPost (
yearID INTEGER,
round TEXT,
teamIDwinner TEXT,
lgIDwinner TEXT,
teamIDloser TEXT,
lgIDloser TEXT,
wins INTEGER,
losses INTEGER,
ties INTEGER
);
```

---
# Explore SeriesPost

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT round FROM SeriesPost;
```
```
round
-----
WS   
CS   
ALCS 
NLCS 
AEDIV
AWDIV
NEDIV
NWDIV
ALDS1
ALDS2
NLDS1
NLDS2
ALWC 
NLWC 
```

---
# What team *won* the World Series each year? ctd.

+ Simple approach with only SeriesPost table

```sql
SELECT *
FROM SeriesPost
WHERE round = 'WS' LIMIT 10;
```

+ Just the winners
```
SELECT yearID, teamIDwinner, lgIDwinner, wins
FROM SeriesPost
WHERE round = 'WS'
ORDER BY yearID DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

---
# Want the Team Name, etc.

+ Join on Teams

```sql
SELECT t.yearID, t.name, t.lgID, t.divID, s.teamIDloser
FROM SeriesPost AS s, 
     Teams AS t
WHERE s.yearID = t.yearID 
  AND s.round = 'WS'  
  AND s.teamIDwinner = t.teamID
ORDER BY t.yearID DESC
```

+ We included the ID of the losing team.
  + Want the Name of that team.


---
# Compute the table that has both the winner and runner-up for the World Series in each
tuple/row for all years

+ Include
  + the name of the team,
  + league and division,
  + the number of games the losing team won in the series.

<!-- Q8  -->

The result should look something like

```
yearID  name                    lgID  divID  name                    lgID  divID  losses
------  ----------------------  ----  -----  ----------------------  ----  -----  ------
2013    Boston Red Sox          AL    E      St. Louis Cardinals     NL    C      3     
2012    San Francisco Giants    NL    W      Detroit Tigers          AL    C      0     
2011    St. Louis Cardinals     NL    C      Texas Rangers           AL    W      3     
2010    San Francisco Giants    NL    W      Texas Rangers           AL    W      1     
2009    New York Yankees        AL    E      Philadelphia Phillies   NL    E      2     
2008    Philadelphia Phillies   NL    E      Tampa Bay Rays          AL    E      1     
```

+ How do we go about doing this?

---
# Adding the losing team name

+ Join SeriesPost with Teams and Teams
  + Using Teams twice to get the details for the winning team and then the losing team


```sql
SELECT s.yearID, w.name, w.lgID, w.divID, 
                 l.name, l.lgID, l.divID, s.losses
FROM SeriesPost AS s, Teams AS w, Teams AS l
WHERE s.round = 'WS'
  AND s.yearID = w.yearID
  AND s.yearID = l.yearID  
  AND w.teamID = s.teamIDWinner
  AND l.teamID = s.teamIDLoser
ORDER BY s.yearID DESC;  
```

+ Think of the Cartesian Product of tuples and then the WHERE filtering/subsetting
  the tuples



---
# Total Team Salary by Year

+ Start simple

  + Look at the Salaries table
  + Group by teamID
  + Sum the salaries

+ Caution: Wrong
```sql
SELECT SUM(salary) AS payroll, yearID, teamID
FROM Salaries
GROUP BY teamID;
```

---
# Group by yearID and teamID

+ Wrong since summing across all years for a given team

```sql
SELECT SUM(salary) AS payroll, yearID, teamID
FROM Salaries
GROUP BY teamID;
```

+ Group by yearID and teamID to get Payrol for each year for each team

```sql
SELECT SUM(salary) AS payroll, yearID, teamID
FROM Salaries
GROUP BY teamID, yearID
ORDER BY yearID DESC, payroll DESC;
```

---
# Want the team name, the league (NL or AL)

+ Approach

--

+ Join with the Teams table.

```sql
SELECT t.name, SUM(s.salary) AS payroll, s.yearID, t.teamID
FROM Salaries AS s,
     Teams AS t
WHERE s.yearID = t.yearID
  AND t.teamID = s.teamID
GROUP BY s.teamID, s.yearID
ORDER BY s.yearID DESC, payroll DESC;
```

---
# Alternative: Use Subquery

+ Compute the payroll by year and team, as before
+ Join result with Teams
  + same constraints
     + yearIDs match
     + teamIDs match

```sql
SELECT t.name, payroll, s.yearID
FROM (
       SELECT SUM(salary) AS payroll, yearID, teamID
        FROM Salaries
        GROUP BY teamID, yearID
     ) AS s, Teams AS t
WHERE s.yearID = t.yearID
  AND t.teamID = s.teamID
GROUP BY s.teamID, s.yearID
ORDER BY s.yearID DESC, payroll DESC;
```

+ May be easier to think in two steps
+ Non-nested is slightly shorter.

---
# Challenge

+ Add a column indicating whether the team won the world series or not in that year.


--
+ Join with SeriesPost table

---
# Attempt

+ Not correct Red Sox counted 9 times in 2013.

```sql
SELECT t.name, SUM(s.salary) AS payroll, s.yearID, t.teamID, p.teamIDwinner
FROM Salaries AS s
LEFT JOIN Teams AS t
     ON s.yearID = t.yearID
     AND t.teamID = s.teamID
LEFT JOIN SeriesPost AS p
     ON p.yearID = s.yearID
GROUP BY s.teamID, s.yearID
ORDER BY s.yearID DESC, payroll DESC;
```

---
# Debugging Attempt

+ How did we know we were wrong?

+ Add
```sql
 HAVING s.yearID = 2013 AND t.teamID = 'BOS'
```
  to see only the Boston Red Sox

+  Number without joining on SeriesPost - 151530000
+  Number when joining on SeriesPost - 1363770000.0

+ How did we get a factor of 9?

---
# Debugging Attempt continued

+ Examine the tuples from SeriesPost for 2013

```sql
SELECT * FROM
SeriesPost
WHERE yearID = 2013;
```

+ Our JOIN has a tuple for each of these.

+ What do we need to restrict to
   + `teamIDwinner = teamID` ?
   + `teamIDloser = teamID` ?
   + `teamIDwinner = teamID  OR  teamIDloser = teamID` ?
   + `round = 'WS'`
